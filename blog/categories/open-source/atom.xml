    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nearly a year ago, I wrote a gem wrapper for the Yellow Pages <a href="https://github.com/ianbishop/yellow_api">Yellow API</a>.</p>

<p>I had mostly forgotten about it, since no issues have been filed against it and no changes have happened to the API itself.</p>

<p>But, I was happy to see when I check its <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/yellow_api">RubyGems page</a> that it has had over 1,000 downloads in the last year.</p>

<p>That sort of feedback (1K downloads and 0 issues?) definitely inspires me to keep on giving.</p>

<p>Hurray for open source!</p>
